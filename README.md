# Mr. Shuman


This is my first attempt at a from scrach website with a good understanding of HTML and CSS. This is not the finished project. 
Over time this page is going to evolve into a professional webpage that I will confidently display to colleagues and potential 
employers. 

I built this project not only to display my progress, but also to identify areas of weakness. Some of my struggles and time 
constraints lead me to submit a project that is not up to my own standards. I now have a better understanding of the things 
that I will need to work on moving forward. For now progress > perfection. I was able to build this after just a few weeks
 of instruction, and am excited to progress in the course.

The code now follows propers semantic structure, and there are image descriptions to accompany the images.

I'd like to thank everyone that has been active on Slack, sharing notes and trying to get each other to the best possible outcome.

I went with the MIT License as it seemed the most appropriate for this type of project.
