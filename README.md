# Mr. Shuman


This is my first attempt at a from scrach website with a good understanding of HTML and CSS. This is not the finished project. 
Over time this page is going to evolve into a professional webpage that I will confidently display to colleagues and potential 
employers. 

I built this project not only to display my progress, but also to identify areas of weakness. Some of my struggles and time 
constraints lead me to submit a project that is not up to my own standards. I now have a better understanding of the things 
that I will need to work on moving forward. For now progress > perfection. I was able to build this after just a few weeks
 of instruction, and am excited to progress in the course.
